  <h4>What is a CTF?</h4>
  <p>
    CTF (Capture The Flag) is a competition where participants attempt to solve a range of tasks related to cyber security. These challenges
    vary from real life style challenges, such as bypassing authentication on a website, to fun challenges such as time-based scripting
    challenges which require you to do something within a short period of time. In these challenges, the goal is to get a piece of text
    known as a flag, hence the name Capture The Flag!
  </p>
  <h4>What does a flag look like?</h4>
  <p>
    In most CTFs, flags look like CTF{some_phrase_or_random_string_here}, where CTF is commonly replaced with the name of the CTF or the
    organisation running it. In this CTF, flags will be of the style:
    
    <h5 style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold;">WMG{some_phrase_here}</h5>
  </p>
